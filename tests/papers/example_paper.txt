Title: Image Classification with ResNet on CIFAR-10

Abstract:
We implement image classification using ResNet-50 architecture on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Methodology:
We use a ResNet-50 convolutional neural network for image classification.
The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset which contains 60,000 32x32 color images
in 10 classes.

Training Configuration:
- Model: ResNet-50
- Dataset: CIFAR-10 (from torchvision)
- Optimizer: Adam
- Learning rate: 0.001
- Batch size: 32
- Epochs: 10
- Loss function: Cross-Entropy Loss
- GPU: Not required for this small experiment

Evaluation:
We evaluate the model on the test set using accuracy and F1-score metrics.
